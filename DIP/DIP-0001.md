# Easy Cent (EZC) Trading Medium Criterion
## Overview：
EZC(Easy Cent) stablecoin: A kind of on-chain point, converted from DPR, it has non-transferable and non-tradable characteristics. Buying or using EZC is not investment and can pass the SEC's Howey test. Therefore, it can be purchased by any payment methods, such as Credit card, Paypal, Apple store, etc.
## Motivation：
To provide a medium of exchange for payment application and service fee on Deeper chain  to pay for applications and services, which allows to promote the use of on-chain applications at a stable and predictable price.
## Stakeholders：
Developers and users of various applications using the EVM platform
## Principle Description：
Issue a type of stable coin EZC, its exchange rate will be anchored in US dollars (1 EZC = 0.01 USD), through the credit card to be able to conveniently buy stable coins, but also by burning DPR to get the corresponding stable coins, but the DPR exchange rate is floating, according to the DPR market price to adjust the number of EZC exchange.
## Detailed design：
### 1. Fiat currency exchange mechanism.
Buying EZC with a credit card will trigger the mint() method to generate the equivalent amount of EZC into the user's address.
### 2. Burning exchange mechanism.
The DPR market price is Dynamically obtained through the oracle machine model to get data from multiple nodes. It will start with BFT voting, weighted average, and then blockchain will exchange the corresponding stable coin based on DPR/USD price.
### 3. Application incentive mechanism.
* Paying DApp transaction fees through stable coins, which will be deducted directly.
* If the EZC balance is insufficient, priority will be given to automatically burning DPR to obtain the equivalent amount of EZC for payment, and if DPR is insufficient, the user will be reminded that the transaction cannot be made.
* The system will generate equal DPR rewards, and the node providing Server will receive DPR rewards from the system immediately, and the final reward depends on the number of nodes sharing DPR rewards.
### 4. Restrictions.
* EZC is not transferable.
* Cannot be reverse converted to fiat currency.
* EZC exchange limit of 100,000 EZC per account.
## Engineering Difficulties and Workload：
Difficulties: issuing EZC stablecoins and how to ensure interaction with DPR issues.
* issuing EZC stable coins, about 1 day.
* completing EZC interaction with DPR, about 1~2 weeks.
* completing the prophecy machine feeding and intermodulation, about 1~2 weeks.
## Disadvantages：
Need to manage and pair-bind both Deeper and EVM addresses when users use DPR burning to obtain EZCs.
